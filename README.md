# Rokusteer
A simple web-based Roku Remote, just enter your Roku device's IP and you are ready to go!

# How it works

Roku devices allow for ECP (External Control Protocol), which gives it the ability to control a given device within the local network. ECP's included RESTful API lets users control their Roku beyond the official remote apps.

With this in mind, Rokusteer takes advantage of ECP by using the defined API calls for keypresses to be made in to web-interface without having the need to download applications.

My motivation for making Rokusteer was when [Roku removed their web remote tool](http://devtools.web.roku.com/RokuRemote/electron.html) that I used with my laptop to control my TV. While there were other similar web-based Roku remote websites out there, they did not feel adequate to use and lacked polish. I'm hoping that with Rokusteer, it is good to look at as it is to use -- all the while being readily accessible without having the need to download anything.
